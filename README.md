Assignment3

There were two parts to the assignment:

- An additional layer is added to an Artificial Neural Network implementation, and the results are compared with the original implementation and an implementation using the NN package (keras in my solution).
- To identify flowers images using pretrained CNNs (at least 2), using the Oxford db.
